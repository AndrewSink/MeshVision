# MeshVision

## Project Description

MeshVision is a web-based tool designed to visualize and analyze 3D mesh structures, specifically in STL file format. The tool provides a heatmap visualization that represents the area of each triangle in the mesh. It aims to offer insightful data to engineers, designers, and anyone working with 3D models.

## Features

- Upload and visualize 3D STL files
- Compute the area of all triangles in the mesh
- Heatmap visualization to represent the size of each triangle
- Interactive 3D viewer
- Chart representation for area distribution

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to use MeshVision.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MeshVision.git
cd MeshVision
open index.html # or double-click index.html to open in a web browser
```

## Usage

1. **Upload STL File**: Use the file upload button to select an STL file from your computer.
2. **View Mesh**: The mesh will be rendered in the 3D viewer.
3. **Analyze Area**: Click the 'Analyze' button to compute the area of each triangle.
4. **Heatmap**: The heatmap will automatically update to represent the size of each triangle.
5. **Chart View**: Scroll down to see the chart that represents the area distribution.
